# Upgrade 0.33 to 0.34

Change `startupjs` and all `@startupjs/*` dependencies in your `package.json` to `^0.34`.

## BREAKING CHANGES

`startupjs/ui/tabs`
- no longer requires `react-native-gesture-handler` and `react-native-reanimated` packages. You can remove them from your `package.json` if you don't need them in other libs.

- now requires `react-native-pager-view`. Run the following 
```js
  yarn add react-native-pager-view
```

- you can see all changes [here](https://github.com/satya164/react-native-tab-view/releases).
